# Project Change Checklist

This checklist tracks the major changes introduced in the "Void Dynamics learning memory system" update and highlights recommended follow-up work to fully harden the feature set.

## Completed Changes
- [x] Established a flat `eslint.config.js` aligned with modern ESLint presets to stabilize linting.
- [x] Added a committed `package-lock.json` capturing the resolved dependency graph after installation.
- [x] Updated `package.json` scripts and dependency pins, including `@eslint/js@9.9.0`, to support the new lint/build flow.
- [x] Streamlined UI components (`AgentCollaboration`, `AutonomousEngine`, `AgentSettings`, `AgentStatusPanel`, etc.) to centralize autonomous configuration handling and improved stop messaging.
- [x] Refined collaboration context assembly, corpus upload helpers, and knowledge utilities for resilient chunking and structured prompting.
- [x] Hardened LaTeX rendering by extracting shared tokenization helpers into `src/lib/latex.ts`.
- [x] Introduced `src/types/autonomous.ts` and extended autonomous utilities to manage structured responses and safeguards.
- [x] Added Tailwind spacing tokens in `src/main.css` to unblock production CSS builds.
- [x] Implemented the Python `src/void_dynamics` package (manager, memory state, territories, persistence, utils) encapsulating the Void Dynamics learning system.
- [x] Wrote regression tests: `tests/void_dynamics/test_manager.py` for lifecycle validation and `tests/lib/knowledge-utils.test.ts` for context assembly behaviors.
- [x] Added `vitest.config.ts` to wire the TypeScript tests into the toolchain.

## Recommended Follow-Ups
- [x] Document the Void Dynamics API and integration points in `README.md` or dedicated docs to guide contributors (`docs/void-dynamics.md`).
- [x] Add high-level architecture diagrams describing how the Python memory manager interoperates with the TypeScript collaboration pipeline (Mermaid diagram in `docs/void-dynamics.md`).
- [x] Implement end-to-end tests that exercise the agents with the new memory manager active to verify cross-language integration (`tests/e2e/void-integration.test.ts`).
- [x] Evaluate performance and memory footprint of `VoidMemoryManager` under realistic workloads; add benchmarks or profiling guidance (`Performance & Benchmarking` section).
- [x] Provide migration notes or scripts for existing deployments to adopt the new autonomous configuration defaults and memory persistence format (`scripts/migrate-autonomous-config.mjs`).
- [x] Confirm adherence to the Hybrid-Clean architecture guidelines by separating presentation, business logic, domain, and infrastructure boundaries where applicable (`docs/architecture.md`).
- [x] Set up CI jobs to run both the Python unittest suite and Vitest suite to prevent regressions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- [x] Add failure-injection coverage that exercises reinforcement, decay, and condensation paths under simulated queue backpressure to ensure the manager recovers without data loss. (`tests/void_dynamics/test_failure_injection.py`)
- [x] Capture automated nightly performance telemetry (heat decay, reward EMA, territory churn) and publish trend reports to spot regressions before release. (`src/void_dynamics/telemetry.py`, `scripts/nightly_telemetry.py`, `reports/void-telemetry-latest.*`)
- [x] Document an operational runbook for restoring memory persistence snapshots and replaying collaboration history after catastrophic outages. (`docs/runbooks/memory-restore.md`)
- [x] Add automated anomaly detection thresholds to nightly telemetry so reward EMA or heat spikes raise alerts without manual review. (`src/void_dynamics/telemetry.py`, `scripts/nightly_telemetry.py`, `docs/operations/telemetry.md`)
- [x] Schedule quarterly disaster-recovery drills that execute the runbook on staging snapshots and log the outcomes for audit trails. (`scripts/disaster_recovery_drill.py`, `.github/workflows/quarterly-disaster-drill.yml`, `docs/runbooks/memory-restore.md`)
