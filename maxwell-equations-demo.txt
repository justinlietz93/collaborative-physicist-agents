Maxwell's Equations - Classical Electrodynamics

Introduction
Maxwell's equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electrodynamics, classical optics, and electric circuits.

Gauss's Law
The first Maxwell equation relates the electric flux through any closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface:

∮ E⃗ · dA⃗ = Q_enclosed / ε₀

In differential form:
∇ · E⃗ = ρ / ε₀

This equation states that electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges.

Gauss's Law for Magnetism
The second Maxwell equation states that the magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero:

∮ B⃗ · dA⃗ = 0

In differential form:
∇ · B⃗ = 0

This equation reflects the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist - magnetic field lines always form closed loops.

Faraday's Law
The third Maxwell equation describes electromagnetic induction:

∮ E⃗ · dl⃗ = -dΦ_B/dt

In differential form:
∇ × E⃗ = -∂B⃗/∂t

A changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field.

Ampère-Maxwell Law
The fourth Maxwell equation relates the magnetic field to electric current and the changing electric field:

∮ B⃗ · dl⃗ = μ₀I_enclosed + μ₀ε₀ ∂Φ_E/∂t

In differential form:
∇ × B⃗ = μ₀J⃗ + μ₀ε₀ ∂E⃗/∂t

The displacement current term (μ₀ε₀ ∂E⃗/∂t) was Maxwell's key insight, enabling the prediction of electromagnetic waves.

Wave Equation Derivation
Taking the curl of Faraday's law:
∇ × (∇ × E⃗) = ∇ × (-∂B⃗/∂t) = -∂/∂t(∇ × B⃗)

Substituting Ampère-Maxwell law:
∇ × (∇ × E⃗) = -∂/∂t(μ₀J⃗ + μ₀ε₀ ∂E⃗/∂t)

In vacuum (J⃗ = 0):
∇ × (∇ × E⃗) = -μ₀ε₀ ∂²E⃗/∂t²

Using the vector identity ∇ × (∇ × E⃗) = ∇(∇ · E⃗) - ∇²E⃗ and Gauss's law (∇ · E⃗ = 0 in vacuum):

∇²E⃗ = μ₀ε₀ ∂²E⃗/∂t²

This is the wave equation with speed c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s.

Electromagnetic Wave Properties
- Transverse waves: E⃗ ⊥ B⃗ ⊥ direction of propagation
- Energy density: u = ½(ε₀E² + B²/μ₀)
- Poynting vector: S⃗ = (1/μ₀)(E⃗ × B⃗)
- Momentum density: g⃗ = S⃗/c²
