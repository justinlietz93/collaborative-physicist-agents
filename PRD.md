# Collaborative Physicist Agent System - Product Requirements Document

A sophisticated AI application that orchestrates specialized physics agents to collaboratively derive and validate complex scientific theories through rigorous iterative processes.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Rigorous** - Every derivation must meet the highest standards of scientific accuracy and logical consistency
2. **Collaborative** - Multiple specialized agents work together, each contributing their unique expertise to the scientific process
3. **Intelligent** - The system learns and builds upon previous work, maintaining context and advancing toward user-defined scientific goals

**Complexity Level**: 
- Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
  - Multi-agent orchestration with sophisticated state management, persistent knowledge stores, and real-time collaboration requires advanced architectural patterns

## Essential Features

### Agent Orchestration System
- **Functionality**: Coordinates three specialized physics agents (Phys-Alpha, Phys-Beta, Phys-Gamma) through defined interaction cycles
- **Purpose**: Ensures systematic, rigorous approach to physics derivation with appropriate oversight
- **Trigger**: User initiates derivation process with scientific goal
- **Progression**: Phys-Alpha initiates → Phys-Beta extends → Cycle repeats → Phys-Gamma intervenes every 2 cycles → Continue until termination
- **Success criteria**: Agents complete cycles within defined protocols, maintain scientific rigor

### Dual Knowledge Management
- **Functionality**: Stores all interactions in both vector store (semantic search) and knowledge graph (structured relationships)
- **Purpose**: Enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval and relationship mapping for context-aware derivations
- **Trigger**: Any corpus ingestion or agent interaction
- **Progression**: Content chunked → Vector embeddings generated → Knowledge graph nodes/edges created → Synchronized storage → Query-ready
- **Success criteria**: Zero data loss, sub-second retrieval, consistent synchronization between stores

### Dynamic Context Assembly
- **Functionality**: Curates relevant context for each agent turn from multiple knowledge sources
- **Purpose**: Provides agents with optimal information to make informed derivation decisions
- **Trigger**: Agent begins new turn in cycle
- **Progression**: Vector similarity search → Knowledge graph traversal → Previous agent output integration → Goal contract alignment → Context package delivery
- **Success criteria**: Context relevance score >0.8, assembly time <2 seconds

### Goal Contract Management
- **Functionality**: Converts user's scientific goal into structured JSON contract and maintains alignment
- **Purpose**: Ensures all agent work remains focused on user's ultimate scientific objective
- **Trigger**: User defines or modifies scientific goal
- **Progression**: Free-form goal input → LLM summarization → JSON schema validation → Contract storage → Continuous alignment checking
- **Success criteria**: Goal accurately captured, alignment maintained throughout cycles

### Agent Customization Interface
- **Functionality**: Allows users to configure each agent's persona, approach, and specialization parameters
- **Purpose**: Tailors agent behavior to specific scientific domains or methodological preferences
- **Trigger**: User accesses agent configuration
- **Progression**: Configuration UI access → Parameter adjustment → Validation → Agent instance update → Behavior verification
- **Success criteria**: Customizations persist and demonstrably affect agent behavior

## Edge Case Handling
- **Infinite Loops**: Circuit breaker terminates after maximum cycles or detects repetitive patterns
- **Knowledge Conflicts**: Phys-Gamma arbitrates contradictory derivations with confidence scoring
- **Storage Failures**: Graceful degradation with local caching and retry mechanisms
- **Agent Hallucinations**: Cross-validation between agents and knowledge base consistency checks
- **User Goal Drift**: Automatic realignment detection and user confirmation prompts

## Design Direction
The interface should feel like a sophisticated scientific laboratory - clean, precise, and purposeful. The design must convey intellectual rigor while remaining approachable, balancing complex functionality with intuitive navigation for researchers and scientists.

## Color Selection
Custom palette - A scientific, academic color scheme that conveys trust, intelligence, and precision.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Navy Blue (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Communicates depth of knowledge and scientific authority
- **Secondary Colors**: Cool Gray (oklch(0.65 0.02 240)) for supporting elements, Warm White (oklch(0.98 0.01 90)) for backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Brilliant Blue (oklch(0.6 0.15 230)) - Highlights key actions and progress indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Warm White oklch(0.98 0.01 90)): Dark Navy text (oklch(0.15 0.05 240)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Navy oklch(0.25 0.08 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (Brilliant Blue oklch(0.6 0.15 230)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey scientific precision and academic authority while maintaining excellent readability for complex mathematical content.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (System Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Agent Names): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Section Headers): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body (Derivations): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height for readability
  - Code (Equations): JetBrains Mono/14px/monospace for mathematical expressions

## Animations
Animations should feel measured and purposeful, reflecting the deliberate nature of scientific inquiry while providing clear feedback about system state and agent activity.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions between agent turns convey the collaborative process, subtle loading states indicate computation without distraction
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Agent status indicators receive priority animation, followed by knowledge visualization, with UI chrome remaining stable
